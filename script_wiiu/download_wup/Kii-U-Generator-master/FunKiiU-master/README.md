# FunKiiU

FunKiiU is a Python tool, compatible with Python 2.7 and 3, to download Wii U content from N's CDN.

  - It supports games, dlc, updates, virtual console, demos, **any** content.
  - By default DLC will be patched to unlock all pieces of DLC.
  - By default demos will be patched to remove any play count limits. *(does Wii U have this?)*


FunKiiU will accept keys and generate tickets, but you do not have to enter a key.
- You can choose to get the key automatically from **-thekeysite-**.
- Or, you can choose to get a legit ticket from **-thekeysite-** instead.
- **¡¡On first use, you will need to provide the url of -thekeysite-!!**
    - **Here is a hint** - https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=wiiu%20title%20key%20site   

Using **keys** will generate a ticket that is not legit, the Wii U needs signature patches to accept it. (This is possible now, but a bit tricky to set up.)

Using **tickets** will download a ticket that is legit, and once installed, the content will work without any hacks at all. This is ideal, yet there are not and will not be tickets for **all** content that exists.

The downloaded output can then be installed using **wupinstaller**, or any similar tool.
I recommend this wupinstaller mod - https://github.com/Yardape8000/wupinstaller/releases/latest
